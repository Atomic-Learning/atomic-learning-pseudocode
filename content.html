In the Atomic Learning platform, there are many pieces of content that teach various concepts of programming. In many places these concepts will apply to many different programming languages. To make this content relevant to all learners, pseudocode will often be used to describe and illustrate these concepts.

This will allow you to learn the concept in the abstract first. After you understand the concept, you will often progress to learn how to apply it in a specific programming language. This has the advantage that you will have a deeper understanding of the concept. In addition, if you learn a different programming language in the future, you will not be required to repeat the conceptual learning, as you will have already completed it.

When reading pseudocode in the Atomic Learning Platform, do not focus on the specific syntax used. Instead, focus on the logic and structure of the code to understand the underlying concepts being taught.
